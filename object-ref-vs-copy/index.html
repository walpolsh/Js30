// Let's say we have an array

// You might think we can just do something like this:
team[3] = 'Lux';

// however what happens when we update that array?
// now here is the problem!
// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();
const team3 = [].concat(players);
const team4 = [...players];
const team5 = Array.from(players);
team4[3] = 'John'

console.log(team, team2, team3, team4, team5);

// one way
// or create a new array and concat the old one in
// or use the new ES6 Spread
// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
// with Objects
const person = {
  name: 'Paul',
  age: 28,
};

// and think we make a copy:
const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;
// console.log(captain.number, person);

// how do we take a copy instead?
// assign(blank object, original array, object containing parameters we want to change.
const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 18 });
captain2.number = 28;
captain.age = 28;

console.log(captain2, captain, person);

// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
//const captain3 = {... person}

// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
